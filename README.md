## Description
This project will randomly pick from three effects and play that effect for four minutes, and then switch to another effect.  The three effects are Candle Simulation, a Green Radioactive Glow, and a slow Random Color Cycle.
This project demonstrates the use of the NeoPixelBus library, and the advanced use of the Task library.

## Install
To install, Clone this into your Arduino folder; which will place it in a folder named ArdiunoJackONeoLatern.

### Library dependecies
The following libraries will be required for this project to build. You can find them in the same place you found this.  
NeoPixelBus - provides the interface to the NeoPixels.  This project relies on the Master branch.
Task - provides non-preemptive task support and timing.  
RandomSeed - provides a call that generates a good random seed.
